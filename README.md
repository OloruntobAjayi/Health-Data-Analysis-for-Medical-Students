![](PNG.png)

## Introduction

In this in-depth examination of medical student data, I look into significant demographic and health aspects revealing important insights by building pivot tables, including average age, BMI, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol for men and women, accurate height and weight statistics, a breakdown of blood groups, and a clear image of the smoking and diabetes status of pupils. 

Join me as I analyze these potential medical professionals' health profiles...üôÇüòâ

## Medical-Students of "ADX TEACHING HOSPITAL"
The task is to create Pivot Tables displaying the following:
1. Average values for the following for Male and Females (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol)
2. Average Height and Weight for both Genders (in 2 decimal places)
3. Number of students across the different Blood Groups
4. Number of Students who smoke and those who don't
5. Number of Students who have diabetes and those who don't. in 60 words, give me a better introduction to explain to people

## Problem Statement for TASK_TWO

The primary goal of the analysis is to draw insightful conclusions from the sales data, including the average revenue for "Paseo," the volume of sales in the "Government" and "Midmarket" segments, the total revenue from "Montana" sales in Canada, the highest unit of goods sold in a given region, segment, and month, and the total profit in December.

## Skill and Concept Demonstrated:

The analysis had demonstrated a range of essential data analysis skills, such as:
- Data extraction
- Manipulation, and Visualization
- Statistical measures and conditional logic to make data-driven decisions.
- Excel functions (e.g., XLOOKUP, SUMPRODUCT)

## Visualization
To calculate the average revenue generated from each sale of 'Paseo,' I used the **AVERAGEIF** function in Excel. Additionally, to find the number of sales in the 'Government' and 'Midmarket' segments, I employed the **SUMPRODUCT** function. Moreover, to determine the total revenue from the sales of 'Montana' in Canada, I utilized **SUMIFS**. Furthermore, for identifying the highest unit of goods sold, I used the **MAX** function at first and then I used the **XLOOKUP** function to locate the country, segment and month with the highest unit sold . You can refer to the attached Excel files for more details and the visual representation of this data is presented below:

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on our analysis:

- 'Paseo' generates an average revenue of **$163,422** per sale. Consider optimizing sales strategies for 'Paseo' to increase revenue further.
- 'Government' and 'Midmarket' segments account for a total of **400** sales. Focus on these segments to generate more sales which can lead to potential growth opportunities.
- 'Montana' sales in Canada have contributed **$2,711,919** in revenue. We can explore methods to enhance the performance of 'Montana' products.
- **'United State of America'** country, **'Government'** segment, as well as the month **'Apiril'** had the highest unit of goods sold. We can Investigate what factors led to this exceptional performance and consider to apply thesame strategy to the least unit of goods sold and where sales ar abysmally poor.
-   Lastly, we realized a total profit of **2,717,330** in the month of December; consider using such tactics in other situations after analyzing the factors that led to this month's high profits.

  
This analysis provides actionable insights to optimize sales strategies and improve revenue. Further investigations and implementation of the recommendations can lead to better business outcomes.
